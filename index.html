		<h2>Look around you. Look at what is going on in your life. Then look at what is going on all over the world</h2>
		
		<p>
			This timely end-of-year retreat is designed to move you to clarity on how you may employ spiritual tools to help you mentally and emotionally cope with all that is happening around the globe—with leaders on the world stage loudly and belligerently threatening to destroy each other, with global warming whipping up storms to a level we have never seen before, and with social and political issues dividing people more profoundly and disturbingly than ever—to say nothing of the shifting conditions in our personal lives. Using the eye-opening messages of the Coexist Foundation as a source and a reference point, these three days could bring you closer to inner peace than you have been in a very long time.
